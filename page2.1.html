<h1> Boston Latin Academy Varsity Soccer </h1>
<img src= "soccer.jpg" width=600>
<p/> Since freshman year I have been apart of the varsity girls soccer team at Latin Academy, being appointed one of the captains senior year. We won 3 city championships and competed in states 4 times. Ive been playing soccer since I was 7 and its one of my favorite things. I've met some of my closest friends through it and hope I can play again soon.
