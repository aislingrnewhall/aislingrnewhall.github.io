<h1> Aisling's Family </h1>

<img src= "fam.jpg" width=600 >

<p/> To the left is my 24 year old brother Aidan and the younger two are Ava (7) and Sheamus (5). Ava and Sheamus are my half siblings on my dads side and live in South Boston. My brother Aidan lives in California with his fiance, Caila. Family is really important to me because I grew up in a very large one and was constantly surrounded by them, having the majority of them live in Charlestown.
